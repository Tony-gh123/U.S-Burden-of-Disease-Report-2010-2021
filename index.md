<br>

### Risk Factor Trends (2010–2021)

- **Decreasing in Risk Exposure**: Particulate matter pollution (SEV: –39%), smoking (SEV: –15%), LDL cholesterol (SEV: –3%).

- **Increasing in Risk Exposure**: High systolic blood pressure (SEV: +39%), high fasting plasma glucose (SEV: +16%), high BMI (SEV: +8%), low physical activity (SEV: +20% in men), kidney dysfunction (SEV: +4%).

### What this means for policy & practice

1. Ischemic Heart Disease remains the top cause of mortality, while Hypertensive Heart Disease and Ischemic Stroke are rising. Opioid Use Disorders mortality has more than doubled. These areas demand urgent attention to prevent further increases in mortality.

2. Declines in 'Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung Cancer', Colorectal Cancer, Diabetes, and Intracerebral Hemorrhage show that prevention works. Sustaining anti-smoking efforts, cancer screening programs, and other proven interventions will continue this trend.

3. High Blood Pressure, High Blood Sugar, Obesity, and Low Physical Activity are all trending upward. These risk factors cut across multiple diseases, amplifying the burden. Addressing them will reduce future deaths.

## How To Read This Report

**Data Source**: Data obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 Study, grouped by US estimates 2010-2021.

**Metrics**: 

- **ASMR (Age-Standardized Mortality Rate)**: Deaths per 100k people, adjusted for age. 
   _Example: Comparing 2010 vs 2021 heart disease risk without being skewed by an older population._

- **Total Deaths**: The raw number of people who died. _Useful for planning hospital beds, workforce, budgets._

- **All-Age YLLs (Years of Life Lost)**: Total years of life cut short by early death. _Example: If someone dies at 50 instead of 80, that’s 30 YLLs._ 

- **Age-Standardised Rate - YLLs**: YLLs per 100k, age-adjusted. _Helps compare premature death burden across time and groups._

- **DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years)**: YLLs + years lived with disability. _Captures both early death and time spent in poor health._

- **SEV (Summary Exposure Value)**: How much of the population is exposed to a risk × how strong that risk is. Reported as % change between 2010–2021.

- **PAFS (Population Attributable Fractions)**: represent the proportion of disease burden that could be prevented if specific risk exposures were eliminated. PAFs are model-based and generally do not sum to 100% of disease burden.

Estimates include a 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). _Example: Ischemic heart disease 2021 ASMR = 78.91, but the 95% uncertainty range is (69.67–83.78)._

**PAF Rating Reference Table**

| Risk-Outcome Score (ROS) | Star Rating | Interpretation |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| ≤ 0                      | 1           | No or very weak evidence  |
| 0 – 0.14                 | 2           | Weak evidence (up to 15% ) |
| 0.14 – 0.41              | 3           | Moderate evidence (15–50% increase) |
| 0.41 – 0.62              | 4           | Strong evidence (50–85% increase) |
| > 0.62                   | 5           | Very strong evidence (>85% increase) |

# Cause-Specific Mortality & Risk Attribution

In the following section, each leading cause of mortality is analyzed using a consistent framework that combines medical definitions from the National Library of Medicine, observed trends in disease burden, simple summaries of their public health significance, and the strongest risk contributors supported by quantitative evidence on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Included are risk factor tables that highlight the strength of association between exposures and outcomes, along with attribution estimates that show what percent of each disease is linked to preventable risks.

_Ischemia is defined as inadequate blood supply (circulation) to a local area due to blockage of the blood vessels supplying the area. Ischemic means that an organ (e.g., the heart) is not getting enough blood and oxygen. Ischemic heart disease, also called coronary heart disease (CHD) or coronary artery disease, is the term given to heart problems caused by narrowed heart (coronary) arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle._

- _From 2010 to 2021, the age-standardized YLLs fell from 1,749 → 1,490 per 100k (−15%)._

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide. It arises when narrowed coronary arteries restrict blood flow to the heart muscle, depriving it of oxygen. The condition can remain silent for years but often culminates in heart attacks or chronic heart failure, making it one of the most devastating and costly public health challenges. 

**Key risk contributors** 

- High systolic blood pressure (94k DALYs, very strong evidence).

_Strokes are classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic, with hemorrhagic strokes further divided into intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages. Among ischemic strokes, the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification system is commonly used to categorize subtypes, which include: Cardioembolism, Small vessel occlusion, Large artery atherosclerosis, Stroke of undetermined etiology, Stroke of other determined etiology._

### **Hypertensive heart disease**

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>View Medical Definition</summary>

[5]
_Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) refers to a constellation of structural and functional changes in the left ventricle, left atrium, and coronary arteries resulting from chronic blood pressure elevation. Hypertension increases myocardial workload, leading to compensatory remodeling, most notably left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which may progress to heart failure._

</details>
&nbsp;

**Signal**: <span style="color:darkred"><strong>❌ Worsening</strong></span>

- _From 2010 to 2021, the age-standardized YLLs increased from 208 -> 245 per 100k (+18%)._ 

Hypertensive heart disease (HHD) develops as a long-term complication of chronic high blood pressure. Unlike ischemic heart disease, which results from blocked coronary arteries, HHD stems from the heart’s constant struggle against elevated pressure, leading to structural remodeling, thickened walls, and eventual heart failure. 

**Key risk contributors** 

The GBD framework does not currently attribute HHD to specific risk factors beyond elevated blood pressure itself. One modeled factor, non-optimal temperature, shows only weak evidence.

**Risk Factor Table**

| Risk Name               | Outcome Name               |   Risk-Outcome Score |   Star Rating | 2021 DALYS (in thousands)   | Risk Type                   |

*Attribution:* The absence of many listed “risks” here doesn’t mean the disease is mysterious. GBD models treat high blood pressure as a cause for HHD rather than a risk input; that’s why few risk factors appear in the HHD table.

[8]
_Dementia is a general term used to describe a significant decline in cognitive ability that interferes with a person's activities of daily living. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most prevalent type of dementia, accounting for at least two-thirds of cases in individuals aged 65 and older. AD is a neurodegenerative condition with insidious onset and progressive impairment of behavioral and cognitive functions. These functions include memory, comprehension, language, attention, reasoning, and judgment. While AD does not directly cause death, it substantially raises vulnerability to other complications, which can eventually lead to a person's death._

</details>
&nbsp;

**Signal**: <span style="color:darkorange"><strong>🟧 Unchanged</strong></span>

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are not sudden killers like stroke or heart attack, they are slow, progressive conditions that erode memory, judgment, and independence over years. While dementia itself rarely appears as the “immediate cause” of death, it greatly increases vulnerability to infections, falls, and other complications that ultimately shorten life.

In 2021, dementia accounted for an age-standardized YLLs of 356 per 100k, unchanged since 2010 (−1%). Absolute years of life lost increased by 27%, from 1.85M -> 2.34M. This rise is driven almost entirely by population aging, as more Americans live longer, more enter the age brackets where dementia is common. For women, who generally outlive men, dementia ranks even higher among causes of death.

## Chronic respiratory diseases

### **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>View Medical Definition</summary>

[9]
_Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and treatable disease characterized by progressive airflow limitation and tissue destruction. It is associated with structural lung changes due to chronic inflammation from prolonged exposure to noxious particles or gases most commonly cigarette smoke. Chronic inflammation causes airway narrowing and decreased lung recoil. The disease often presents with symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and sputum production. Symptoms can range from being asymptomatic to respiratory failure._

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often called a “smoker’s disease,” but it’s more accurately the long-term scarring of the lungs from years of exposure to cigarettes, polluted air, and other noxious particles. Once damage accumulates, it limits airflow permanently, leaving many patients struggling with breathlessness, recurrent infections, and in severe cases, respiratory failure.

## Cancers

### **Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung Cancer**

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>View Medical Definition</summary>

[10]
_Initially described in 1785 by Sandifort, the tracheal bronchus is a rare congenital anomaly in which an accessory bronchus originates directly from the trachea, usually directed toward the upper lobe of the lung. This condition is more common on the right side and is typically discovered incidentally during imaging or bronchoscopy for other reasons._

[11]
_Lung cancer or bronchogenic carcinoma refers to tumors originating in the lung parenchyma or within the bronchi. It is interesting to note that lung cancer was a relatively rare disease at the beginning of the 20th century. Its dramatic rise in later decades is mostly attributable to the increase in smoking among both males and females._

- _From 2010 to 2021, the age-standardized YLLs dropped from 865 → 620 per 100k (−28%)._

Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung Cancer remains one of the most lethal cancer groups in the United States, historically driven by widespread tobacco use in the 20th century. Today, it continues to be a leading cause of cancer death, though recent decades have seen encouraging declines. Advances in tobacco control, cleaner air standards, and early detection have shifted trends, reducing both risk and mortality. Despite this progress, the disease still imposes a heavy burden, largely tied to modifiable risk factors like smoking and air pollution. 

**Key risk contributors** 

- Smoking (27.7k DALYs, very strong evidence)
- Particulate matter pollution (8.9k DALYs, moderate evidence)
- Diets low in fruits (1.6k DALYs, moderate evidence)

### **Colon and rectum cancer**

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>View Medical Definition</summary>

[12]
_Most colon cancer is sporadic, and approximately 5 percent are due to an inherited genetic mutation, mostly due to Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer or HNPCC) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The transition from normal colon epithelium to invasive cancer takes several years and most commonly follows a sequence characterized by the accumulation of genetic mutations, adenoma formation, and subsequent carcinogenesis (adenoma-carcinoma sequence). (NLM (12)). Colon and rectal cancers (CRC) combined are the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States and the second deadliest. Rectal cancer has distinct environmental associations and genetic risk factors different from colon cancer.The transformation of the normal rectal epithelium to a dysplastic lesion and eventually an invasive carcinoma requires a combination of genetic mutations, either somatic (acquired) or germline (inherited), over an approximately 10 to 15 year period. Response to pre-operative therapy and pathological staging are the most important prognostic indicators of rectal cancer._

Colon and rectum cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. Most cases develop sporadically over a decade or more, through the gradual progression from benign polyps to invasive cancer, though a small fraction arise from inherited syndromes such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis. Because the disease develops slowly, timely screening and early removal of precancerous lesions are key to reducing mortality. 

**Key risk contributors** 

- Diet low in calcium (2.1k DALYs, moderate evidence)

### **Prostate cancer**

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>View Medical Definition</summary>

[13]
_Prostate cancer is an adenocarcinoma as it develops primarily from the glandular part of the organ and shows typical glandular patterns on microscopic examination. The cancer cells grow and multiply, initially spreading to the surrounding prostate tissue, forming a tumor nodule. Such a tumor may grow outside the prostate (extracapsular extension) or may remain localized within the prostate for decades. Prostate cancer commonly metastasizes to the bones and lymph nodes. Metastases to the bone are believed to be partially due to the prostatic venous plexus draining into the vertebral veins._

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. While it often remains localized and slow-growing for many years, advanced cases can metastasize, particularly to the bones and lymph nodes, leading to significant health burden. Despite its prevalence, the precise risk factors behind prostate cancer are not fully understood, which complicates prevention strategies.

_Most breast cancer is sporadic (90%-95%), with only 5% to 10% of patients having an identifiable genetic mutation. BRCA 1 and 2 are the most common associated genetic conditions. Invasive ductal and invasive lobular carcinoma are the most common pathologic forms of invasive breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in the US and remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. While 5–10% of cases can be traced to inherited mutations, the vast majority (90–95%) are sporadic, shaped by a complex interplay of hormones, environment, and lifestyle.

[15]
_Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. It may be due to impaired insulin secretion, resistance to peripheral actions of insulin, or both. Chronic hyperglycemia in synergy with the other metabolic aberrations in patients with diabetes mellitus can cause damage to various organ systems, leading to the development of disabling and life-threatening health complications, most prominent of which are microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications leading to a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular diseases._

- _From 2010 to 2021, the age-standardized YLLs fell from 298 → 259 per 100k (−13%)._

Type 2 diabetes is the quintessential lifestyle-driven chronic disease. It develops when the body can no longer use insulin effectively, leading to persistent high blood sugar that silently damages blood vessels, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. Beyond its direct complications, diabetes multiplies the risk of cardiovascular disease, making it one of the largest drivers of premature mortality in the US. 

**Key risk contributors** 

- High body-mass index (39k DALYS, strong evidence).
- Particulate matter pollution and smoking (moderate evidence)

Behavioral risks; smoking, low physical activity, diets low in fiber/whole grains, and consumption of processed meats and sugary drinks collectively account for tens of thousands of DALYs.

## Substance use disorders

### **Opioid Use Disorders**

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>View Medical Definition</summary>

[16]
_Opioid use disorder (OUD) is defined as the chronic use of opioids that causes clinically significant distress or impairment. Symptoms of this disease include an overpowering desire to use opioids, increased opioid tolerance, and withdrawal syndrome when opioids are discontinued. Thus, OUD can range from dependence on opioids to addiction._

&nbsp;

**Signal**: <span style="color:darkred"><strong>❌ Worsening</strong></span>

- _From 2010 to 2021, the age-standardized YLLs more than doubled, from 363 → 772 per 100k (+112%)._

Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is not driven by diet, blood pressure, or cholesterol, it is a disease of dependency, born from pain management, social vulnerability, and the biology of addiction. OUD blurs the line between medical treatment and illicit use, as patients prescribed opioids for pain can find themselves trapped in cycles of tolerance, craving, and withdrawal. 

For Opioid Use Disorder, one could attribute lead risk factors as social and environmental as addiction feeds addiction and drugs had to be started to develop addiction. Further roads to addiction are medication (pain killers) and overall mental health scape routes for people.

Because these drivers are diffuse and socially embedded, the Global Burden of Disease framework does not assign a clean population attributable fraction (PAF) as it does for smoking or obesity. The crisis is less about biology and more about policy, prescribing practices, and social safety nets.

## Risk Exposure Trends 2010-2021

Below is an excerpt outlining the percent change of each risk exposure mentioned as a factor of the diseases studied above and key highlights. 

- Exposure to particulate matter pollution fell by (-39%) for both men and women, showing major progress in air pollution control.
- Smoking dropped by (-15%), continuing a decades-long downward trend. 
- Alcohol use stayed roughly the same (slight increase for women, stable for men).
- Fruit and vegetable intake showed little change, with slight improvement in fruit intake but stagnation in vegetables.
- Whole grains and dairy (milk) remain low with minimal change.
- Processed meat consumption decreased modestly (esp. among women), while red meat intake stayed about the same.
- Sugar-sweetened beverages showed no meaningful decline, remaining a persistent issue.
- Low physical activity increased (esp. in men, +20%), suggesting sedentary lifestyles remain a growing concern.
- High body-mass index (BMI) rose by (+8%) overall, reinforcing obesity as a worsening driver of chronic disease.
- High fasting plasma glucose (+16%) and high systolic blood pressure (+39%) saw the sharpest increases, especially among women.
- High LDL cholesterol improved slightly (–3%), likely reflecting widespread statin use and improved treatment.
- Kidney dysfunction showed small increases (+4%).
